# Angular Enterprise Example

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OasisDigital/scalable-enterprise-angular.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OasisDigital/scalable-enterprise-angular)

This is a **work in progress**. It is likely to have many changes over time,
particularly as all of the tools improve.

## Goals

1. Show an example of a sprawling set of related Angular applications, divided
   into various libraries.
2. Manage complexity, size, and scale.
3. Provide a way to "bloat up" with numerous randomly generated additional
   modules/features/components, up to the size of the largest Angular
   applications.
4. Initially use Angular CLI and Nx.
5. Later, Bazel.

## Contents so far

* 3 applications, using overlapping sets of...
* 10 libraries
* dependencies between the libraries
* A Node server, which serves REST/JSON, SSE, and GraphQL

## Technologies used

* Angular 5
* Angular CLI
* Nx
* NgRx/Store, Store addons
* RxJS
* Lodash, Moment
* REST
* SSE (Server Sent Events)
* GraphQL

### Example application(s)

This set of example applications/features use Nx to wire up inter-project
dependencies during development. Following the Nx convention, they are divided
into "apps" and "libs".

There is a many-to-many relationship between applications and modules, and
modules can use other modules.

In addition, there is a "servers" directory intended to contain one or more
server-side example code bases that support the Angular example. These are not
managed using Nx, which is Angular specific. However, in a sprawling set of
related servers and libraries, Lerna could be used too much the same effect.

The example applications are not very complex - certainly not complex enough to
warrant the amount of complexity used to build it. Real application of this
modest complexity could easily be written as a single project (each).

Still, the example applications reuse blocks of functionality, so they show the
value of this multi-package approach.

There are three application to run:

* Admin - bundles 5 feature modules
* Agent - bundles 2 feature module
* Portal - bundles 1 feature module

To understand how they are cross wired, look at the tsconfig.json file for each.

Two of the modules use ngrx/store for state management, With appropriate lazy
loading of feature modules.

### Running

In one window:

```
yarn
yarn start
# add --app=agent or --app=portal if desired
```

In another window:

```
cd servers/node
yarn
yarn start
```
